sdf*: shell script based distributed processing
==============================================

This set of scripts runs any number of "scrip jobs" on any number of computers
using simply a network and a common disk storage location.  

I haven't looked at this code in over a year as I switched 
to using R and doRedis so if you have any questions, feel
free to ask, I'll try to help as soon as I find time.

Comments inside the code and jEdit with proper code folding
plugins should be enough to figure everything out.

_* Why it is called 'sdf': this short name is easy to type and because
it stands for 'scripted distributed (processing) framework'._
