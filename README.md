sdf: shell script based distributed processing
==============================================

This set of scripts runs any number of "scrip jobs" on any number of computers
using simply a network and a common disk storage location.  

I haven't looked at this code in over a year as I switched 
to using R and doRedis so if you have any questions, feel
free to ask, I'll try to help as soon as I find time.

Comments inside the code and jEdit with proper code folding
plugins should be enough to figure everything out.

_* Why 'sdf' ? - because it's faster to type and it wasn't yet
taken by some *nix utility (at least on my system)._
